# Flight Timers for Deadly Boss Mods (Classic)

**Only supports Classic at the moment, only tested on Season of Discovery.**

Hop on a Gryphon, Wyvern or whatever your local flight master offers and this mod will show you a DBM timer for the remaining time.

## Features

* Timers for all flight paths in Classic
* Timers for intermediate stops
* Updates timer if you request an early stop
* Independent of client locale, works with all languages

## FAQ

### Timer for my flight was wrong, can you fix it?
We currently just take the timers from InFlight that [are crowdsourced on WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18997&page=27), we currently do not maintain our own database for flights.


## TODO List

* Support WotLK Classic and Retail
* Learn times of unknown or inaccurate flight paths
* Come up with some way for users to contribute these timers
